# gym-sokoban
The repository implements the game Sokoban based on the rules presented [DeepMind's]() paper [Imagination Augmented Agents for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7152-imagination-augmented-agents-for-deep-reinforcement-learning). The room generation is random and therefor will allow to train Deep Neural Networks without overfitting on a set of predefined rooms.
WORK IN PROGRESS
